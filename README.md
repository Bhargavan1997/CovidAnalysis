# CovidAnalysis

Analysis of covid-19 pandemic globally

In this project I did an analysis of covid-19 pandemic all over the world and did a visualization of the results by building a dashboard. I leveraged python programming language by utilizing pandas library for reading, cleaning and analysing datasets from the source. For visualization, I utilized the dash library of plotly. It is a very handy framework explicitly for building web analytical applications. More information about the library is given in this link - [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/)

# Dataset

The dataset is acquired from [OurWorldinData](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data). The description of the dataset is given in its [Github page](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-codebook.csv). There are lots of attributes in the dataset and new attributes are added by the source. I used only few attributes to analyse the cases affected and tests taken all over the world.

# Analysis

The following analysis/visuals are made in this project:
 * A choropleth map view of countries with number of cases globally
 * A timeline which shows increase/decrease of new cases from the begining for each country
 * A timeline which shows increase/decrease of new death from the begining for each country
 * A table view of percentage of population covered in covid testing
 * Comparison of total tests taken vs total cases globally
 * Comparison of new tests taken vs new cases globally
 * Top 10 countries with most number of cases, deaths and their respective highest number of spike in cases in single day
